## TECK STACK

# React

https://reactjs.org/

- Good for phones, widely used, has good documentation and a large userbase.
- Very good for dynamic content, able to change content without refresh using useState
- Am experienced at using react
- Great for making reusable code, that is still dynamic

# React Router

- Client side rendering, so navigation is possible without refreshing - it makes navigation faster which is very useful especially on mobile applications.
- It also reduces the number of requests to the website host.

# Tailwind

https://tailwindcss.com/

- Easy setup of default rules, useful for themes, makes development faster by having CSS rules be applied either directly where needed or through tailwind.config
